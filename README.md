This is a school project started in February 2025.

This project is completely written in Java.
It contains a test tool for combined testing of key generators and encryption models.
The test tool was written to answer the question of the efficiency between certain models in relation to brute-force time.
The focus was between encryption via XOR and encryption with XOR and shifting bytes.

This project is still in the building phase and open to everyone who wants to submit their thoughts.
For further questions, write to me on Discord.
